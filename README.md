# To-do-app-Project-2023
complete responsive todo list app with the idea of saving list items in local storage
Project Objective: The objective of this project is to create a fully functional to-do app that meets
the customer's requirements. The app should have the ability to view the optimal layout for the
device's screen size, support hover states for interactive elements, allow users to add new todos,
mark to-dos as complete, delete to-dos, filter to-dos by all/active/complete, clear all
completed to-dos, toggle light and dark mode, and enable drag and drop to reorder items on the
list. The project should be developed as a full-stack application and the end result should closely
match the design provided.
Customer Requirements:
1. View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size.
2. See hover states for all interactive elements on the page.
3. Add new to-dos to the list.
4. Mark to-dos as complete.
5. Delete to-dos from the list.
6. Filter by all/active/complete to-dos.
7. Clear all completed to-dos.
8. Toggle light and dark mode.
9. Drag and drop to reorder items on the list.
10. Develop the project as a full-stack application.
Deliverables: The deliverables for this project include a fully functional web application, complete
source code hosted on GitHub, and a well-written README file. The GitHub repository should
implement Git flow with a reasonable number of commits. The README file should include
installation instructions, usage instructions, and any other relevant information. The web
application should be deployed and accessible via a link. The end result should closely match the
design provided by the customer.
